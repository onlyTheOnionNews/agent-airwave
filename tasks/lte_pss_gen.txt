TASK INITIATION: LTE Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) Generator

Module Name: lte_pss_gen
Target Standard: 3GPP TS 36.211 (Release 10)

Objective:
Design a hardware module to generate the Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) for the downlink of a 4G LTE baseband modem. 

Required Information from Librarian:
1. Identify the exact Zadoff-Chu sequence formula used for the PSS.
2. Provide the three specific root indices ($u$) corresponding to the physical layer identity $N_{ID}^{(2)} \in \{0, 1, 2\}$.
3. Define the sequence length ($N_{ZC}$) and the exact subcarrier mapping (how the 62 sequence elements are mapped to the center 72 subcarriers around the DC subcarrier).
4. Provide any implementation notes regarding whether these sequences should be computed on the fly via DSP or stored in a ROM lookup table for an ASIC target.

Please generate the 'Design Specification Block' and save it to the specs/ directory.
